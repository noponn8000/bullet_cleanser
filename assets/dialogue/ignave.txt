Another drone... What're you doing here, little guy?
Wait a second... those thrusters... XCV-847, produced in 3048.
Quite the curious specification for a run-of-the-mill drone.
And the cannon! Something's off...

AAAAH! Oh, what a misidentification on my part!
Could it be that it's a sentient being?

Anyway... 
It has been a while since I saw anything other than drones and beasts.
Please excuse my manners.
Let us start over, perhaps.

Hello, Ignave here. Ignave pronounced as Ignave, not Ignave.
I am an engineer living in a traffic cone.
I think I might just have a few parts lying around that will fit you.
